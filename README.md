# Create-a-Tableau-Story

First version of the story: https://public.tableau.com/profile/ntavou#!/vizhome/Mil_draft/MIL_v1

## Summary

In this tableau story I compared team and players basic regular season statistics of the Milwakee Bucks 2017/2018 team with these of NBA teams in the Eastern Conference that managed to win their first round playoff series in the last decade. I included in my analysis teams that were placed between the 3rd and the 6th position in the regular season (which I expect that the Bucks will end up in the current season). The main goal of this data story was to see if the Bucks team is on par with these teams across the selected statitical categories.

## Design

I initially present the current standing table to show the performance of the Bucks team so far to give the reader a first look at where the Bucks stands this season. After extensively exploring the dataset I chose to use the green color for the Bucks (which is their main official color) in my visualizations and grey for all other teams to better shown what I am trying to communicate. The decision to compare the Bucks with teams that managed to win their first playoff series in the last decade stems from the fact that Bucks have the longest [NBA playoffs series win droughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_franchise_post-season_droughts) than any other team in the NBA.  I also decided to split the analysis in two main categories: offense and defense team statistics, to make the story flow more naturally for the reader.  When I found a statistic category were the Bucks were way better or worse off than the average of all selected teams, I further included player stats with interactive options to enrich the analysis, after the feedback I received in my initial version of my story. Furtermore, based on the feedback, I used the point differential stat to conclude if the Bucks are on par with the other teams and I also shorten my text boxes descriptions. 

## Feedback

Person one:

I think your descriptions are way too long. I would use the point differential as the last page in your story because it's a great, top down, summary statistic telling of how good the team are. I think it will tie up your story very well. All in all I like the story you are telling!

Person two:

I like your story, but it would be a good idea to add some player stats, instead of presenting only team stats. You also need to fix the title because its second line isn't visible. Adding also the source of your data will make your story look more professional. Also consider adding other types of graphs instead of using only barplots.
